I did all of the trainings and student orientation, and I did not have time to start working on the project yet. 
I spent most of the day doing the training exams and went to have lunch at around 12. I was able to get a rundown from Seongha on what 
I should be doing for my project.

I got started on preprocessing the data. I actually made more progress today than I thought. I was able to create my personal directory in github, and start the blog along with create another directory storing my progress in the project. I was able to convert the Solar Irradiance data that was given by Seongha into a CSV file(at first I attempted to use JSON but quickly found out that the formatting wrong and would take too long to format it correctly). I used the Pandas package in order to scrape the data from the CSV file (I also had to reformat the CSV File to only contain days from the summer along with formatting it correctly to show the correct amount of columns in Colabs). Furthermore, I also created a plot that shows the solar irradiance throughout the whole summer, so that I can get a better idea of how many classes I should use for my overall model.

Today, I was notified that we should only be measuring solar irradiance during the certain times of the day when the sun is likely to be out rather than times at night. Furthermore, I cleaned all the data for the images in order to retain only the images that are timestamped between 6:00AM and 8:00PM using Pandas and the Date Time library from python. I coded a function that would only pick one image per 15 minutes so I can eventually match the images with each row of data from the CSV file. There is is still a disparity between the number of rows of data in the Solar Irradiance and the number of images that I processed; I will continue to work toward closing this disparity so the index of a row can correspond to both the image and the respective Solar Irradiance

Today I went to my first team meeting, and it was very cool to hear about the projects that other interns were working on. I was able to introduce myself to the rest of them, and give them all an update on the progress I had made in my project. After the meeting, I worked to finish my student quadchart introduction slide, and also uploaded it onto my github folder. Throughout the day I was thinking about how to identify which images did not match up with the data chronologically since I want both dataframes to have the same timestamp in each row so that they can be matched up. I finished the algorithm to do so, but I received a bug that set me back about an hour and a half, which was an indexing error; because dataframes do not automatically reset the indexing after dropping rows from a dataframe, I had forgotten to reset the indices. However, by the end of the day I had figured it out, and now the matching of the data should be finished quickly.


# Friday June 16th, 2023
Today I worked my first remote day. I began the day by utilizing the function that I had thought of yesterday in order to finish cleaning the data up. I managed to be able to finally match the images with the solar irradiance data. I combined the dataframes into a final, cleaned up, dataframe where one column stores the paths to the images while the other column stores the respective radW/m^2 measurement. I also began to think of how I was going to store the images into classes/folders. I finalized the approach to storing these images on google drive by iterating through the dataframe and storing the images in respective folders with each range being 100, meaning each class would be 0-100, 100-200, etc. all the way till 1000-1100. I initially planned on using my Macbook to store the folders but quickly came to the realization that since I am working on colabs it had no access to my Mac's storage. I then pivoted by doing a bit of research and coming to the conclusion of using google drive, so I first connected the colab to my google drive by importing the package 'drive'. I then created a new class column in the dataframe to store whichever class each image belonged to. For next week, I plan on using this column 'class' to both create a folder and store the images respective to their irradiance value,

Today I worked on downloading all the images over to my local directory in their correct respective solar irradiance classes. I eventually figured it out but found that some images were still dark even though the time that they were taken were already filtered so that it removed darker images. This is when I was notified by Seongha that the images were taken in UTC time while the data were taken in CST time; granted, there was a feature on the sage website to check at which times the photos were taken, and I had completely forgotten to check if there was a timezone difference. So, I worked more on cleaning data and pairing up the images and the data based on their timestamps. I should be able to finish tomorrow since I have most of the functions to do it and downloading images should also be able to be done by tomorrow.
