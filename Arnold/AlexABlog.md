**June 19th 2023**  
I went through orientation in the morning and completed all the required training tasks in Dash just to get them out of the way. Then I created my quad chart and started familiarizing myself with the Waggle github sage python libraries and interface. I talked with Seongha at 2 just to discuss the first steps for my project and to try to make it so I have access to the actual image data. I also set up my environment and plan to start implementing and intial draft of a ResNet model for snow classification tomorrow in PyTorch.
